EPub import is currently considered feature-complete for the purpose of importing an ePub file to use as source text for quotes.

I don't plan to add any additional features to this, like image import. For the purpose of extracting text quotes from a source text, importing images are irrelevant and only serve to increase the size of your vault for no reason.

If someone wants to code a feature up and submit a Pull Request, I'll have a look at it, but I won't be adding anything additional myself.
