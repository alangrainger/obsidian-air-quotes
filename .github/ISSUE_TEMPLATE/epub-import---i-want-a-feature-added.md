EPub import is considered feature-complete for the purpose of importing an ePub file to use as the source text for quotes.

If you require additional features for your ePub import, you can use one of the many existing fully-featured ePub to Markdown tools such as Pandoc or Calibre.

If someone wants to code a feature up and submit a Pull Request I'll have a look at it, but I have no current plans to add anything additional myself to the ePub import.
